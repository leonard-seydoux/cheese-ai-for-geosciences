This notebook contains a series of questions to which you should answer. Some example cells are given in the notebook to help you. You should not modify these cells. You can add as many cells as you want to answer the questions. You can also add markdown cells to explain your approach. 

The goal here is to allow you to evaluate your knowledge of Python and scientific libraries and to apprehend the requirements for these practicals. The following suite of exercices are supposed to be fully understood and solved before the beginning of the practicals in order to fully benefit from the practicals. If you feel you do not master the following exercices, please take time to go through this notebook step-by-step and to reach out to the teaching team if you have any question.
